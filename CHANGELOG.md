## Team Mode v1 — ADR-0001 §10 resolved (2026-05-10)

**Branch:** `feat/team-mode-foundation-rfc` (PR #118)

### What shipped

- **Sub-coach assignment surface**: `POST /team/sub-coaches`, `GET /team/sub-coaches`, `DELETE /team/sub-coaches/:subCoachId`. All endpoints carry per-route `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, CoachGuard)` matching the Sprint B v2.1 pattern. Writes throttled at 30/min.
- **Curated audit feed**: `GET /team/audit-events` with cursor pagination, `event_kind` / `target_client_id` / date-range filters. Default page size 50, max 200. The 15 enum values in `TeamAuditEventKind` (session_held, message_sent, plan_assigned, checkin_logged, macro_target_set, meal_plan_assigned, workout_assigned, client_progress_logged, sub_coach_assigned, sub_coach_removed, client_reassigned, invite_sent_by_sub_coach, tier_changed, staff_seat_added, staff_seat_removed) deliberately bound the surface — not a CRUD firehose.
- **Stripe staff seats**: Pro tier adds one `subscription_item` (quantity = 1) per sub-coach. Removal deletes the item. Idempotency keys on both calls. Enterprise tier creates the assignment row but skips the Stripe call (included). When `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` or `STRIPE_PRICE_STAFF_SEAT` is unset, the local row + audit events still land and the Stripe call is skipped with a logged warning.
- **Tier gate**: `TeamModeTierResolverService` resolves tier from `CoachSubscription.stripe_price_id` via env-var mapping. Pro and Enterprise pass; Growth and unknown receive a 403 with `{ kind: 'team_mode_locked', current_tier, required_tier: 'pro', upsell_url: '/pricing' }`. Defence in depth at both controller and service.
- **Sub-coach client invites (Q5)**: `InviteCodesService.createForCoach` auto-detects sub-coach context via a `TeamSubCoachAssignment` lookup. Invite is then attributed: `coach_id` is set to the head coach (so existing tenancy + signup flows keep working) and `invited_by_user_id` is the sub-coach. A matching `invite_sent_by_sub_coach` audit event is written best-effort.
- **Many-to-2 sub-coach relationship (Q2)**: A sub-coach may be assigned under up to 2 head coaches at once. Enforced at the service layer (clean 409 envelope) AND by a Postgres trigger `enforce_subcoach_head_cap()` so a concurrent double-write cannot exceed the cap.
- **Removal auto-reassigns clients (Q3)**: Removal flips `User.coach_id` from sub-coach to initiating head coach for every active student in a single Prisma transaction, writes one `client_reassigned` audit event per reassigned client, plus a `sub_coach_removed` summary event and a `staff_seat_removed` event when a Stripe item id was attached. Stripe failure does not roll back the local archive — the error is recorded in audit metadata for ops reconciliation.
- **2 new tables + 1 enum + 1 column**: `TeamSubCoachAssignment`, `TeamAuditEvent`, `TeamAuditEventKind` (15-value Postgres enum), `InviteCode.invited_by_user_id` (nullable, FK to User, ON DELETE SET NULL). Migration `20260510000000_add_team_mode/`. Additive only.
- **Validation**: `event_kind` query param validates against the 15-value enum and returns 400 (BadRequest) with `{ kind: 'invalid_event_kind', allowed: [...] }` on mismatch.
- **Env vars** (set in production): `STRIPE_PRICE_GROWTH`, `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO`, `STRIPE_PRICE_ENTERPRISE`, `STRIPE_PRICE_STAFF_SEAT`. Documented in `.env.example` and `docs/architecture/adr-0001-team-mode-foundation.md` §10a.

### Tests

129 suites, 1237 passing, 0 failing (was 1103 baseline post-Sprint-B-v2.1; +101 from this PR's five new specs, +28 absorbed from AI Gateway #140 rebase, +5 from audit-fix specs).

### Out of scope (deliberate)

- Pro → Enterprise mid-flight tier upgrade is not handled in v1 (existing line items remain billable until removed). v2 follow-up.
- The broader 6-role permission matrix (`team_owner`, `setter`, `ops`, etc.) is preserved as documentation in `src/common/team-mode/` but not yet wired into the v1 runtime.
- Mobile screens for sub-coach add/remove are Sprint B-2 work.

### Known limitation

- The `enforce_subcoach_head_cap()` trigger has a millisecond race window under PostgreSQL `READ COMMITTED` if two concurrent inserts both observe `head_count = 1` for the same sub-coach. Recoverable by an admin archiving one row. Follow-up: add `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on existing rows inside the trigger or escalate isolation.

---

## Phase 9 — Notifications Matrix (2026-05-07)

**Branch:** `feat/phase-9-notifications-matrix`

### What shipped

- **Notification center API**: `GET /notifications` (paginated, cursor-based, unread filter), `POST /notifications/:id/read`, `POST /notifications/mark-all-read`
- **Notification preferences API**: `GET /notifications/preferences`, `PATCH /notifications/preferences` — replaces Phase 6B `PUT` with semantically correct `PATCH`; 27 per-kind-per-channel flags plus global `muted` toggle
- **7 emitters** in `src/notifications/emitters/`:
  - `milestone-reached` — client hits a personal body/streak/build-week milestone
  - `message-received` — coach sends a message to a client
  - `missed-checkin` — client misses 3+ consecutive check-ins (notifies both client and coach)
  - `weight-trend-alert` — multi-day weight trend detected
  - `checkin-submitted` — client submits daily check-in (notifies coach)
  - `build-week-day-unlocked` — coach approves a gate and next day opens
  - `coach-alert` — mirrors `CoachAlert` table entries into the unified inbox
- **Email digest**: Handlebars templates for client daily, coach daily, client weekly, coach weekly. Templates in `src/notifications/templates/`
- **Digest cron jobs** (`DigestScheduler`): three configurable cron schedules; idempotency enforced via `NotificationDigestLog` unique constraint on `(user_id, digest_kind, window_date)`
- **2 new DB tables**: `Notification` (in-app inbox), `NotificationDigestLog` (idempotency guard)
- **Extended `NotificationPreferences`**: 27 new boolean columns (9 kinds × 3 channels) + `muted` global flag
- **Push rate limiting**: 1 push per user per kind per 60 seconds (in-process; Redis path documented for scale)
- **Privacy**: digest bodies use first names only; no weight/income/financial data from other users in any notification
- **READMEs**: `src/notifications/README.md` (full matrix, endpoint table, model table, env vars, tests), `src/notifications/templates/README.md`

### Migrations

- `prisma/migrations/20260507000000_add_notification_center/migration.sql` — adds `Notification` table, `NotificationDigestLog` table, 28 new columns on `NotificationPreferences`

### New env vars

| Var | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `EMAIL_DIGEST_CLIENT_ENABLED` | `on` | Set to `off` to disable |
| `EMAIL_DIGEST_COACH_ENABLED` | `on` | Set to `off` to disable |
| `CLIENT_DAILY_CRON` | `0 7 * * *` | UTC cron |
| `COACH_DAILY_CRON` | `0 6 * * *` | UTC cron |
| `WEEKLY_DIGEST_CRON` | `0 8 * * 0` | UTC cron, Sunday |
| `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` | `noreply@thegrowthproject.app` | Sender address |
| `EMAIL_TRANSPORT` | `log` | `resend`, `sendgrid`, `postmark`, or `log` |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | — | When `EMAIL_TRANSPORT=resend` |
| `SENDGRID_API_KEY` | — | When `EMAIL_TRANSPORT=sendgrid` |
| `POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN` | — | When `EMAIL_TRANSPORT=postmark` |
| `APP_URL` | `https://app.thegrowthproject.app` | Client digest CTA |
| `CONSOLE_URL` | `https://console.thegrowthproject.app` | Coach digest CTA |

### Follow-ups

- Wire real APNs/FCM SDK in `NotificationsService.pushToCoach` once `User.push_token` column is added
- Migrate in-process push rate-limit to Redis for multi-replica deployments
- Add `GET /notifications/digest-log` (owner-only) for send-history inspection

## 2026-05-15 — Phase 10: Observability

### What shipped

**New module: `src/observability/`**

Production-grade observability for The Growth Project backend.

- **Structured logging** (`app-logger.service.ts`): replaces the default NestJS
  pretty-printer with a JSON logger.  Every line is a single-line JSON object
  with `timestamp`, `level`, `context`, `request_id`, `user_id`, `method`,
  `path`, `status`, `latency_ms`, and `message`.  Controlled by `LOG_LEVEL`
  and `LOG_FORMAT` env vars.

- **Log redaction** (`log-redaction.ts`): recursive `redactObject` walk
  replaces 31 sensitive key names (passwords, tokens, bloodwork, Stripe keys,
  CVV) with `"[REDACTED]"` before any line is written.  A belt-and-suspenders
  `redactLogLine` pass runs on the serialised string as well.

- **Request tracing** (`request-id.middleware.ts`): `RequestIdMiddleware`
  generates a cryptographic `X-Request-ID` per request (or honours an incoming
  one), attaches it to the log context, and returns it as a response header.
  Added to all error response bodies via `HttpExceptionFilter` so support
  engineers can correlate mobile client errors to server logs.

- **Request logging** (`logging.interceptor.ts`): `LoggingInterceptor` emits
  one structured log line per request on completion (success and error paths)
  and drives Prometheus counter/histogram updates.

- **Prometheus metrics** (`metrics.service.ts`, `metrics.controller.ts`):
  `GET /metrics` (no auth) serves Prometheus text format 0.0.4 with:
  - `http_requests_total` (counter, labels: method/route/status)
  - `http_request_duration_ms` (histogram, buckets: 10/25/50/100/250/500/1000/2500/5000 ms)
  - `db_query_total` (counter, labels: model/operation)
  - `redis_op_total` (counter, labels: command)

- **Deep health check** (`health-deep.controller.ts`): `GET /health/deep`
  (no auth) checks DB connectivity via `SELECT 1` and Redis connectivity via
  `PING`.  Returns 200 when all dependencies are healthy; 503 with an `errors`
  array when any fail.

- **CPU profiler** (`profiling.controller.ts`): `GET /debug/profile` starts a
  30-second V8 CPU profile and streams the `.cpuprofile` file.  Requires OWNER
  role AND `PROFILE_ENABLED=on`.  Defaults to off.

**Updated: `src/filters/http-exception.filter.ts`**
- Added `request_id` field to all 4xx/5xx JSON response bodies.
- Added `request_id` to Sentry scope tags for cross-tool correlation.

**Updated: `src/app.module.ts`**
- `ObservabilityModule` registered as the **first** module import so
  `RequestIdMiddleware` runs before `JwtAuthGuard` and `AuditModule`.

**New env vars** (all optional, safe defaults):
- `LOG_LEVEL=log`
- `LOG_FORMAT=json`
- `METRICS_ENABLED=on`
- `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1`
- `PROFILE_ENABLED=off`

**Tests** (`test/observability.spec.ts`):
- 30 assertions covering: redaction, request-id generation, metrics format,
  health check response shapes.

### Not changed
- `src/audit/` — owned by the audit-logging agent; untouched.
- No Prisma migrations — this module adds no database tables.

---

## Phase 10 — Rate limiting (2025-01)

### Added

- **Extended throttler config** (`src/throttler/throttler.config.ts`): replaced the single `auth-login` named throttler with a two-layer set of 10 named throttlers covering every route family in the spec. New throttlers: `auth-login-per-min` (5/min/IP), `auth-login-per-hour` (30/hr/IP), `auth-password-reset` (3/hr/IP), `auth-signup` (5/hr/IP), `coach-messages` (30/min/user), `notifications-prefs` (30/min/user), `bloodwork-write` (30/min/user, applied when module ships), `coach-command-center` (60/min/user, applied when module ships), `diagnostic-submit` (5/hr/IP), `default` (300/min/user or 100/min/IP). All limits are overridable via env vars with sane defaults and clamped ranges.

- **`LoginThrottleResetService`** (`src/throttler/login-throttle-reset.service.ts`): clears both `auth-login-per-min` and `auth-login-per-hour` counters for the caller's IP after a successful login. Called from `POST /auth/login`, `/auth/apple`, and `/auth/google`. Prevents a user on a bad Wi-Fi connection from being locked out for an hour after eventually succeeding.

- **`ThrottlerModule`** (`src/throttler/throttler.module.ts`): lightweight module that exports `LoginThrottleResetService` for injection into `AuthModule` and any future module that needs to interact with throttler state.

- **Updated `UserThrottlerGuard`** (`src/throttler/user-throttler.guard.ts`): added `canActivate()` override to skip all throttle checks for health-probe paths (`/health`, `/healthz`, `/readyz`) so Fly.io liveness probes can never exhaust the per-IP quota. Added `Fly-Client-IP` header support as the highest-priority IP source in `getTracker()` (before `X-Forwarded-For` and `req.ip`).

- **Updated `ThrottlerExceptionFilter`** (`src/filters/throttler-exception.filter.ts`): 429 responses now include a `Retry-After` HTTP header (integer seconds, RFC 7231) and a `retryAfter` field in the JSON body. The sanitized body still reveals no internal limit details.

- **Updated `AuthController`** (`src/auth/auth.controller.ts`): login/apple/google handlers now use `auth-login-per-min` + `auth-login-per-hour` dual throttlers (5/min + 30/hr per IP, down from 10/min). Password-reset uses `auth-password-reset` (3/hr, down from 5/15min). All `@Throttle` decorators reference `THROTTLER_NAMES` constants rather than bare strings.

- **Updated `CoachMessagingController`** (`src/messaging/coach-messaging.controller.ts`): `POST /coach/clients/:id/messages` now uses the named `coach-messages` throttler instead of the anonymous `default` bucket.

- **Updated `NotificationsController`** (`src/notifications/notifications.controller.ts`): `PUT /notifications/preferences` now uses the named `notifications-prefs` throttler (30/min/user).

- **Env vars**: 10 new optional env vars (`RATELIMIT_ENABLED`, `RATELIMIT_AUTHED_PER_MIN`, `RATELIMIT_ANON_PER_MIN`, `AUTH_LOGIN_PER_MIN`, `AUTH_LOGIN_PER_HOUR`, `AUTH_PWD_RESET_PER_HOUR`, `COACH_MESSAGES_PER_MIN`, `NOTIF_PREFS_PER_MIN`, `BLOODWORK_WRITE_PER_MIN`, `COACH_CMD_CENTER_PER_MIN`). Added to `.env.example` and `src/common/env-validation.ts`.

- **`src/throttler/README.md`**: full route table (route → limit → window → tracker key), 429 response shape, env-var reference, storage backend docs, future-work notes.

- **`test/rate-limit.spec.ts`**: comprehensive test suite — named limit table, `@Throttle` metadata assertions on every throttled handler, `getTracker` IP resolution (Fly-Client-IP priority, XFF fallback, IP fallback, unknown), health-path skip, 429 response shape + `Retry-After`, global `APP_GUARD` wiring, Redis/in-memory fallback, `THROTTLER_NAMES` uniqueness + completeness.

### Changed

- `auth-login` (single 10/min limit) → split into `auth-login-per-min` (5/min) + `auth-login-per-hour` (30/hr). Both must be declared in the `@Throttle` decorator on each login endpoint; the throttler fires whichever is exhausted first.
- `auth-password-reset` window: 5/15min → 3/hr (tighter sustained cap, wider window).
- Default catch-all limit: 60/min → 300/min for authenticated users (was conservative; user-id keying makes 300/min safe), 100/min for unauthenticated.

### Notes for the next operator

- The `bloodwork-write` and `coach-command-center` throttlers are fully configured in the limit table and tested but not yet applied as `@Throttle` decorators — those route families don't exist yet. Add the decorator to the handler when the module ships.
- Set `REDIS_URL` before scaling beyond one Fly machine so limits are shared across the fleet.

## Phase 10 — GDPR delete (right to erasure) — 2026-05-08

Added a complete two-phase deletion flow in `src/account-deletion/`.

**What changed:**

- New module `src/account-deletion/` with controller, service, tests, and README.
- New endpoints:
  - `POST /me/delete-account` — requests deletion, sends a single-use 24-hour email confirmation link.
  - `GET /me/delete-account/confirm?token=...` — confirms deletion via one-time token; starts the 14-day grace period.
  - `POST /me/delete-account/cancel` — cancels a pending deletion within the grace window.
  - `GET /me/delete-account/status` — returns machine-readable deletion state (`none | requested | confirmed | deleted`).
  - `POST /admin/users/:id/delete` — admin (OWNER role) force-delete; bypasses confirmation and grace period; fully audited.
- New Prisma migration `20260507100000_add_gdpr_deletion_flow`:
  - Adds `deletion_requested_at`, `deletion_confirmed_at`, `deletion_token_hash`, `deletion_token_expires_at` to `User`.
  - Creates `deletion_audit` table for GDPR audit trail.
- Per-model cascade strategy: documented inline in service. Hard-delete for user-owned data; delete for cross-party rows with non-nullable FKs; anonymize (null actor) for AuditLog; delete for CoachMessage threads (sender body cleared).
- Nightly finalize cron (default 03:00 UTC via `DELETION_FINALIZE_CRON`) scrubs PII on accounts past the grace period. Idempotent.
- New env vars: `DELETION_GRACE_DAYS=14`, `DELETION_FINALIZE_CRON`, `DELETION_TOKEN_TTL_HOURS=24`.
- `AccountDeletionModule` wired into `AppModule`.

**Dependencies / follow-ups:**

- Data export (Phase 10 Wave C) must ship before this flow is enabled in production — GDPR Art. 20 portability must precede erasure.
- Email confirmation is logged to console in this PR; wire to Phase 9 transactional mailer before go-live.
- Supabase Auth user cleanup (delete auth row when account is finalized) is a follow-up.

---

## Phase 10 — Data Export (2026-05-08)

### Added

- **GDPR right to data portability (Article 20)** — users can request a complete JSON export of all their personal data.
  - `POST /v1/me/data-export/request` — enqueue export; rate-limited to 1 per 24 hours.
  - `GET /v1/me/data-export/status` — poll export status (`PENDING` → `RUNNING` → `READY`).
  - `GET /v1/me/data-export/download?token=` — redirects to S3 presigned URL; never pipes file through API.
  - Export includes: user profile, weight/food/water/workout logs, fasting windows, habits, check-ins, meal plans, coaching messages (own messages verbatim, third-party messages redacted), build week progress, diagnostic submissions, PTM signals, audit log entries about the user, and more. Full model table in `src/data-export/README.md`.
  - 7-day signed download link emailed to user on completion.
  - S3-compatible storage with server-side AES256 encryption. Falls back to local filesystem when `DATA_EXPORT_BUCKET` is unset.
  - Nightly cleanup cron (03:00 UTC) marks expired exports and deletes files from storage.
  - Prisma migration: `data_export_request` table with `DataExportStatus` enum.

- **Mobile: Data Export screen** — `src/screens/settings/DataExportScreen.tsx`
  - "Request my data" button with explanation of what's included.
  - Status display: pending / in-progress (auto-polling every 5 s) / ready / failed / expired.
  - "Download file" button when ready — opens signed URL in external browser.
  - Wired into Client Settings and Coach Settings screens.

- **Compliance docs** — `docs/compliance/data-portability.md` (GDPR Article 20 implementation notes).

### New env vars

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `DATA_EXPORT_TOKEN_SECRET` | (must set in prod) | Signs the download JWT. |
| `DATA_EXPORT_BUCKET` | — | S3 bucket. Falls back to filesystem if unset. |
| `DATA_EXPORT_S3_ENDPOINT` | AWS default | Custom S3 endpoint (Fly/MinIO). |
| `DATA_EXPORT_FS_DIR` | `/tmp/exports` | Filesystem fallback directory. |
| `DATA_EXPORT_EXPIRY_DAYS` | `7` | Days the download link stays valid. |
| `DATA_EXPORT_RATE_LIMIT_HRS` | `24` | Hours between requests per user. |
| `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_PORT` / `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASS` / `SMTP_FROM` | — | Email delivery for the ready notification. |

---

## [Unreleased] — Phase 10: Audit Logging Expansion

### Added

- **`AuditAction` enum expanded** — 16 new action constants in `src/audit/audit.service.ts`:
  `auth.login`, `auth.login_failed`, `auth.apple_signin`, `auth.password_change`,
  `auth.biometric_unlock_setup`, `coach.assigned_client_change`, `coach.viewed_client_data`,
  `ptm.risk_board_view`, `notification.pref_change`, `bloodwork.view`,
  `bloodwork.disclaimer_acked`, `bloodwork.entry_created`, `bloodwork.entry_updated`,
  `leaderboard.optin_changed`, `consent.granted`, `consent.revoked`.

- **`AuditController`** — new `GET /admin/audit/log` endpoint (owner-only, JWT + RolesGuard).
  Identical filter and pagination contract to the legacy `/admin/audit-log`. Added to
  `AuditModule` controllers array.

- **`AUDIT_LOGGING_ENABLED` kill switch** — optional env var read on every `AuditService.write()`
  call. Set to `off` to suppress audit writes without touching call sites. Documented in
  `.env.example` and `src/audit/README.md`.

- **Auth hooks** — `auth.service.ts` writes `auth.login` on successful email/password login,
  `auth.login_failed` on credential failure (metadata: `{ reason: "invalid_credentials" }` —
  password never stored), and `auth.apple_signin` on successful Apple Sign-In. Controller
  passes `auditContext(req)` for IP and user-agent capture.

- **Coach hooks** — `coach.service.ts` writes `coach.viewed_client_data` after the client
  ownership check passes in `getClientTimeline()` and `getClientSummary()`. Fire-and-forget
  (`void`), so failures never block the response.

- **PTM hooks** — `admin-ptm.service.ts` writes `ptm.risk_board_view` when the controller
  supplies an actor context. Existing `ptm.outcome_labelled` hook unchanged.

- **Notification hooks** — `notifications.service.ts` writes `notification.pref_change` on
  `updatePreferences()`. Metadata contains only the changed key names, never the new values.

- **`src/audit/README.md`** — full module README covering the endpoint contract, Prisma model,
  the complete action enum table with metadata fields, redaction policy, services wired,
  test coverage, retention policy, and future work.

- **`test/audit-phase10.spec.ts`** — 11 test groups covering kill switch behavior, action
  constant correctness, append-only contract enforcement, `AuditController` role guard, auth
  audit payload shapes (login, login_failed never contains password, apple_signin never
  contains token), coach/PTM/notification audit payload shapes.

### Changed

- **`src/audit/audit.module.ts`** — added `AuditController` to the `controllers` array.
- **Root `README.md`** — added `AUDIT_LOGGING_ENABLED` to the variable matrix; updated the
  `AuditLog` section to reference Phase 10 wiring; added `GET /admin/audit/log` to route
  contracts; added Phase 10 row to the Open Work / merge-order table.

### Notes

- No new Prisma migration required — the `AuditLog` model and all required indexes already
  existed on `main` from PR #73.
- Bloodwork (`bloodwork.*`) and leaderboard (`leaderboard.optin_changed`) constants are defined
  in this PR; wiring lives in PR #103 (`feat-bloodwork-rails`) and PR #148
  (`feat/phase-7c-peer-leaderboard`) respectively.
- All new service method params use `= {}` defaults to preserve backward compatibility with
  existing tests that construct services without the audit context argument.
